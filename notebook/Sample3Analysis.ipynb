      "Human [[personal names]] are presented, used and categorised in many ways depending on the language and culture. In most cultures (Indonesia is one exception) it is customary for individuals to be given at least two names. In Western culture, the first name is given at birth or shortly thereafter and is referred to as the [[given name]], the [[given name|forename]], the [[baptismal name]] (if given then), or simply the [[first name]]. In England prior to the Norman invasion of 1066, small communities of [[Celt]]s, [[Anglo-Saxon]]s and [[Scandinavia]]ns generally used single names: each person was identified by a single name as either a personal name or [[nickname]]. As the population increased, it gradually became necessary to identify people further – giving rise to names like John the butcher, Henry from Sutton, and Roger son of Richard … which naturally evolved into John Butcher, Henry Sutton, and Roger Richardson. We now know this additional name variously as the [[second name]], [[last name]], [[family name]], [[surname]] or occasionally the [[byname]], and this natural tendency was accelerated by the Norman tradition of using surnames that were fixed and hereditary within individual families. In combination these two names are now known as the personal name or, simply, the name. There are many exceptions to this general rule: Westerners often insert a third or more names between the given and surnames; Chinese and Hungarian names have the family name preceding the given name; females now often retain their maiden names (their family surname) or combine, using a hyphen, their maiden name and the surname of their husband; some East Slavic nations insert the patronym (a name derived from the given name of the father) between the given and the family name; in Iceland the given name is used with the patronym, or matronym (a name derived from the given name of the mother), and surnames are rarely used. [[Nickname]]s (sometimes called [[hypocoristic]] names) are informal names used mostly between friends.\n",

      "===Common names and proper names===\n",
      "{{Main article|Common name| Proper name}}\n",
      "The distinction between [[proper name]]s and [[common name]]s is that proper names denote a unique entity e.g. [[London Bridge]], while common names are used in a more general sense in reference to a class of objects e.g. [[bridge]]. Many proper names are obscure in meaning as they lack any apparent meaning in the way that ordinary words mean, probably for the practical reason that when they consist of [[Collective noun]]s, they refer to groups, even when they are inflected for the [[Grammatical number|singular]] e.g. \"committee\". [[Concrete noun]]s like “cabbage” refer to physical bodies that can be observed by at least one of the senses while [[abstract noun]]s, like “love” and “hate” refer to abstract objects. In English, many abstract nouns are formed by adding noun-forming suffixes (\"-ness\", \"-ity\", \"-tion\") to adjectives or verbs e.g. \"happiness\", \"serenity\", “concentration”. [[Pronoun]]s like \"he\", \"it\", \"which\", and \"those\" stand in place of nouns in [[noun phrase]]s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The capitalization of nouns varies with language and even the particular context: journals often have their own [[Style guide|house style]]s for common names.\n",
      "\n",
      "===-onym nouns===\n",
      "{{Main article|-onym}}\n",
      "Distinctions may be made between particular kinds of names simply by using the suffix [[-onym]], from the Greek ὄνομα (ónoma) 'name'. So we have, for example, [[hydronym]]s name bodies of water, [[synonym]]s are names with the same meaning, and so on. The entire field could be described as chrematonymy - the names of things.\n",

Toponymy has popular appeal because of its socio-cultural and historical interest and significance for [[cartography]]. However, work on the etymology of toponyms has found that many place names are descriptive, honorific or commemorative but frequently they have no meaning or the meaning is obscure or lost. Also the many categories of names are frequently interrelated. For example, many place-names are derived from personal names (Victoria), many names of planets and stars are derived from the names of [[myth]]ological characters ([[Venus]], [[Neptune]]), and many personal names are derived from place-names, names of nations and the like (Wood, Bridge).<ref>Harder, Kelsie B. 1976.

      "Bugs' ascension to stardom also prompted the Warner Bros. animators to recast Daffy as the rabbit's rival, intensely jealous, insecure and determined to steal back the spotlight, while Bugs either remained▛❚ cool headed but▜ mildly amused or indifferent to the duck's jealousy or used it to his advantage. Daffy's desire to achieve stardom at almost any cost was explored as early as 1940 in Freleng's ''[[You Ought to Be in Pictures]]'', but the idea was most successfully used by [[Chuck Jones]], who redesigned the duck once again, making him scrawnier and scruffier. In Jones' famous \"Hunting Trilogy\" (or \"Duck Season/Rabbit Season Trilogy\") of ''[[Rabbit Fire]]'', ''[[Rabbit Seasoning]]'' and ''[[Duck! Rabbit, Duck!]]'' (each respectively launched in 1951, 1952, and 1953), Daffy's attention-grabbing ways and excitability provide Bugs Bunny the perfect opportunity to fool the hapless [[Elmer Fudd]] into repeatedly shooting the duck's bill off. Also, these cartoons reveal Daffy's catchphrase, \"Youuu're deththpicable!\" Jones' Daffy sees himself as self-preservationist, not selfish. However, this Daffy can do nothing that does not backfire on him, more likely to singe his tail feathers as well as his ego and pride than anything.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|pages=159–60|title=That's All Folks!: The Art of Warner Bros. Animation}}</ref> It is thought that Chuck Jones based Daffy Duck’s new personality off of his fellow animator [[Bob Clampett]], who, like Daffy, was known as a loud self-promoter. In ''[[Beanstalk Bunny]]'' Daffy, Bugs and Elmer are once again teamed up in a parody of ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' (with Elmer as the giant) while in the spoofs of the TV shows ''[[The Millionaire (TV series)|The Millionaire]]'' and ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', ''[[The Million Hare]]'' Daffy tries to defeat his arch-rival Bugs Bunny for a $1,000,000.00 prize given out by his favorite TV show and ''[[This Is a Life?]]'' Daffy tries to upstage Bugs Bunny in order to be the guest of honor on the show; in all three of these cartoons Daffy ends up a loser because of his own over-emotional personality  (which impairs Daffy's common sense and reasoning ability) and his craving for attention.\n",

      "'''''Lovesexy''''' is the tenth [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. The album was released on May 10, 1988 by [[Paisley Park Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]], a little over a year after Prince's previous studio album, ''[[Sign o' the Times]]'', which received critical praise and a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. ''Lovesexy'' received mixed reviews; it was issued as a substitute record after the last minute cancellation of the infamous ''[[The Black Album (Prince album)|The Black Album]]''. The album was recorded in just seven weeks, from mid-December 1987 to late January 1988, at Prince's new [[Paisley▛ ❚_▜Park▛ ❚_▜Record▛❚s#Paisley_Park_Studios|Paisley Park Studio▜s]], and most of the album is a solo effort from Prince, with a few exceptions. The opening track, \"Eye No\", was recorded with the full band ([[Miko Weaver]] on guitar, [[Levi Seacer, Jr.]] on bass, [[Doctor Fink]] and Boni Boyer on keyboards, [[Eric Leeds]] on saxophone, [[Atlanta Bliss]] on trumpet and [[Sheila E.]] on drums). Sheila E., in fact, plays drums on several tracks and sings backup, along with Boyer. Leeds and Bliss provide horns on most tracks, and [[Ingrid Chavez]] provides the intro to \"Eye No\".{{sfn|Hahn|2003|p=127}} The album is designed to be heard in the context of a continuous sequence: [[Gramophone record|LP]] pressings split the album in two side-long tracks, without visual bands to indicate individual songs. Similarly, early [[Compact Disc|CD]] copies of ''Lovesexy'' have the entire album in sequence as a single track, though some later editions have it as nine separate tracks. ''Lovesexy'' is also the first Prince album to replace the pronoun \"I\" with a stylized 'eye' symbol, hence the title of \"Eye No\"; however, the 'eye' symbol would not be completely adopted until 1992's ''[[Love Symbol Album]]''.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lyrical themes of the record include positivity, self-improvement, spirituality, and God. It spawned three singles; \"[[Alphabet St.]]\" became a worldwide top-10 hit in the spring of 1988, whereas the follow-up singles \"[[Glam Slam]]\" and \"[[I Wish U Heaven]]\" failed to reach the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. While it was Prince's least successful album in the United States since 1980, it became his first UK number 1 album (where all the singles became top-30 hits) and received critical praise. The album was accompanied by the critically acclaimed [[Lovesexy Tour]], of which the ▛❚September 9th ▜Dortmund show in Germany was released on [[Videotape|video cassette]] and [[LaserDisc]]. It was also televised (with a short delay for editorial purposes) on ▛the British [[Channel 4]]❚several European channels▜, with the broadcast containing various alternate camera shots in place of the ones used in the officially released video, which was released a year later in 1989.\n",
      "\n",
      "The theme of the album is the struggle between good and evil▛, or \"Camille\" and \"Spooky Electric\", respectively❚▜. [[God]] and [[Satan]], virtue and sin (although, with the Gemini character that he developed in 1989, these \"sides\" may also represent \"ego and alter-ego\"), the perennial themes of Prince's work, mix as Prince climaxes to \"Love is God, God is love, girls and boys love God above\" in the song \"Anna Stesia\".\n",

Kilmer shouted, “I’m making ten million on this; you’re only making two”, to which Sizemore responded by throwing a 50-pound weight at Kilmer (which missed). The two were soon refusing to speak to each other or even come onto the set if the other was present, necessitating the use of body doubles to shoot scenes involving both actors, and their relationship became so bad that one of the producers is said to have asked Sizemore not to hit Kilmer in the face when the big fight finally happened - in the event, Sizemore cooperatively landed a knock-down blow on Kilmer’s chest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/tom-sizemore-recounts-fame-battle-sobriety-memoir-article-1.1290899|first=Sherryl|last=Connelly|title=Action star Tom Sizemore recounts his rise and fall from fame and his battle with sobriety in new memoir|journal=[[New York Daily News]]|date=17 March 2014|accessdate=28 February 2016}}</ref> Sizemore has since described the film as one of his career regrets, but also stated that he and Kilmer have since reconciled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/26/tom-sizemore-s-revenge-on-tom-cruise-s-scientology-recruitment-drugs-and-craving-a-comeback.html|first=Marlow|last=Stern|title=Tom Sizemore’s Revenge: On Tom Cruise’s Scientology Recruitment, Drugs, and Craving a Comeback|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=26 September 2014|accessdate=28 February 2016}}</ref>\n",

Greg tries some bad ideas for getting money until he finds out that he can buy \"Drummies\", tasty fried chickens that are sold in his school's holiday bazaar, for less than his school sells so he decides to start his own holiday bazaar and he invites his best friend Rowley to do it with him. They first try to do a cardboard home-made version of [[Pac Man]], but their plan fails as the cardboard of the game falls apart.

Their newspaper doesn't succeed so they decide to hang up posters that advertise their bazaar in their town. They start with hanging up posters at their school but unfortunately, it starts to rain and all the ink spreads so they remove their posters. All of a sudden the color of the paper itself sticks to the school's wall so they get in trouble. Their school and the police start looking for who done it and they do it at school first. They call some students and tell the whole school to tell them who done it anonymously if someone knows.

The phone received particularly polarized reception due to the sensor housing \"notch\" at the top of the screen and the introduction of an all-new authentication method.

Reviewers had mixed reactions, with some condemning it and others acknowledging it as unusual in the first moments of use before getting accustomed to its presence.
