Audit Web Client
===

This is a web interface built using a React front-end and a Flask back-end.

The React front-end is built on a free sample written by Material-UI and Creative Tim: https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard-react

A similar example: https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/docs/src/pages/getting-started/templates/dashboard

The Flask back-end uses SQLite as its database.
