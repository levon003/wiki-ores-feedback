Anomie BOT changes tag date from April 2019 to January 2019. another user 5 hours later leaves no edit summary, but changes Anomie's tag to April 2015 and changes another date in the article to 2015. I'm guessing Anomie changed the date because it hadn't happened yet, and the other user used the wrong date in the first place. it looks like this template is used to tell editors that dates in the article must have a specific format, and the date is used to show editors when the dates were last checked for the correct format by a human or a bot. I think the human user may have been incorrect about the usage of this template and shouldn't have made that change. ***human error?***\n",
