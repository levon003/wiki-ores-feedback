For general filtering, we need the following columns:
wiki_namespace = X  # namespace, 20 unique values
rev_count >= X  # page activity level, 6 unique values in [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

Edit size, see https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec/en.wikipedia.org/Suriname0
delta_bytes < 20 AND delta_bytes > -20  # small edits
delta_bytes < 1000 AND delta_bytes >= 20  # medium additions
delta_bytes >= 1000  # large additions
delta_bytes > -1000 AND delta_bytes <= -20  # medium removals
delta_bytes <= -1000  # large removals
is_minor = X  # Minor revisions, boolean
is_revert = X  # Revert revisions, boolean

is_user_registered = X  # Registration status, boolean
is_user_bot = X  # Bot status, boolean
is_newcomer = X  # Editor experience, boolean
is_learner = X  # Editor experience, boolean
is_experienced = X  # Editor experience, boolean

That's 20 * 6 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 491520 supported filter conditions

For prediction filtering, there's:
damaging_pred >= 0.944  # VLB
damaging_pred < 0.944 AND damaging_pred > 0.301  # Neither
damaging_pred <= 0.301  # LG

For revert filtering, there's:
is_reverted = 1  # required condition
is_self_revert = X  # Boolean
is_reverted_to_by_other = X # Boolean
is_user_trusted = X # Boolean
revert_set_size = X # Multi-reversion reverts, 2 unique values in [1, 1+]
seconds_to_revert = X # Time to revert, 6 unique values in [6 seconds, 6 minutes, 6 hours, 6 days, 6 months, 1 year]
OR is_reverted = 0

That's 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 6 + 1 = 289

To precompute all filter conditions together, that's 141,557,760 combinations.
That's probably too many computations to pre-compute!
However, if we compute the default + all settings that are 1 setting off of the default,
we have only: 68 combinations. Very reasonable!
In other words, could choose combinations using a strategy to build a more reasonable 
pre-computed count set over time, slowly pushing bounds.
Could prioritize counting for sets with large counts... e.g. likely good revisions, non-reverted revisions

In addition, there are very specific filters that can be used.
These should probably have their own indices; just using one results in a tiny dataset.
Note that some are still pretty big: Monkbot has 1,138,488 revisions in our dataset
page_title = X  # for exact page title matches
page_id IN (X, ...)  # for links to and from specific pages
user_text = X  # for exact user matches
